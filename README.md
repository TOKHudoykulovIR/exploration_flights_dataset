# Flights Dataset Exploration
## by Tokhir


## Dataset

> This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays,
from 1987 to 2008. It includes over 7 million rows and 29 columns. The main variables are integers and float numbers. Although most of the variables should serve as time dtype.


## Summary of Findings

> Research has shown that the number of flights is approximately evenly distributed by months and days. The most frequent distance traveled by an airplane is about 300 miles. As you might guess, flights are most often canceled due to weather and carrier and the airport with the highest canceled flights is Chicago International Airport. Canceled flights due to weather were most often registered in December and February.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> As I already said, the main variables in this dataframe are integers and float numbers, and therefore the main part of the study can be done with a large share of the scatterplots. But a significant part of the variables denoted time, which very clearly contributed to the complexity of the analysis and categorical variables were, in principle, of no value.
